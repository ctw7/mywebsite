        <p>My name is Carsen, AKA Tubs.</p>

        <p>I was born in <b>July of '99</b> in Clearwater, Florida.</p>

        <p>
          Since that day I have been finding myself messing with computers
          an awful lot. In that time I probably heard something about
          <i>furries</i> around <b>'07-'08</b> somewhere on the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from that whole thing, I'm intersted in many things, including
          but not limited to: <i>art, photography, music, technology, coffee,
          being scatterbrained, and very indecisive.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          On this website will be links to all my various collections of stuff,
          surrounding these hobbies. I only recently (<b>November of '22</b>)
          decided to start doing all of this, but I will try to backlog some
          things I have done in the past in addition to adding new things
          I will be doing in the future!
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope this website finds you well, and that it bringing you some
          enjoyment in some way.
        </p>
